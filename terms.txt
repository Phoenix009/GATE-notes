NOTE:
    -- There can be multiple minimal and maximal elements in a POSET
    -- Lowerbound and Upperbound exist only for bounded lattice
    -- Minimal and Maximal elements can be found for POSETs it need not be a Lattice
    -- IF there are more than one minmal element then it is not a lattice as for these minimal there is no GLB
    -- IF there are more than one maximal element then it is not a lattice as for these maximal there is no LUB
