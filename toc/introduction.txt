Important topics:
    NFA to DFA
    Regular Expressions
    Regular Languages
    DFA
    Decidability

Basic Terminologies:
    Symbol: The notation we use to form strings of a machine. Ex: Natural numbers, different letters.
    
    Alphabets: Alphabet is a FINITE set of symbols. Ex. character set of C language

    String: 
        -- any sequence over the given alphabet. Empty string is the string with no symbols, it is also called as NULL string.
        -- LEngth of the string represents the number of symbols in the sequence of string
        -- Substring: 
            -- Any sequence of zero or more consecutive symbols of a string is called substring.
            -- Start from any symbol and stop at any symbol after the start
        -- Prefix: 
            -- A substring starting at the first symbol in the string is called a prefix
            -- Start with the first symbol and stop at any symbol.
        -- Suffix: 
            -- A substring ending at the last symbol of the string is called a suffix.
            -- Start with any symbol and stop at the last symbol.
    
    Language:
        -- Set of strings over the given alphabet that follow a set of rules of a grammar is called a language
        -- Are wither Finite Language or inFinite Language
    
    Grammar:
        -- Set of rules that generate the strings of a language.
        -- Grammar is represented using (V, T, P, S)
            V - Alphabets
            T - Terminal Symbols
            P - Production Rules
            S - Start Symbol
