Propositional Logic:
    Propositional Statement: 
        -- Basic building blocks for Logic
        -- Statements that can either be true or false.
        -- Ex: Sun rises in the East and sets in the West --> Is a proposition
               Go out and play --> Not a proposition
        -- Propositional variables are used to represent propositions (small case alphabets)
        -- Are of two types:
            1. Simple Propositional statements: 
                -- That can be broken down into smaller steps.
                -- In mathematical logic the truth value can only be directly determined for simple statements.
            2. Complex Propositional statements: 
                -- Statements that are formed by combining simple statements by using logical connectives
                -- Complex statements can be broken down only on the breakable points (connectives)

        Logical Connectives:
            1. AND (^): TRUE iff both TRUE
            2.1 Inclusive OR (v): TRUE if any one is TRUE
            2.2 EXclusive OR: TRUE only if only one is TRUE
            3. Single Implication: TRUE ke baad FALSE nahi aayega
                -- FOR P --> Q: 
                            -- Q if P
                            -- P only if Q
                            -- Q unless ~P
            4. Double Implication: Same as EXOR

        Special Conditional Statements:
            1. Converse: 
                The converse of the propositions p -> q is q -> p
            2. Inverse:
                The inverse of the proposition p -> q is ~p -> ~q
            3. ContraPositive: 
                The contraPositive of the proposition p -> q is ~q -> ~p

            Example:
                Consider the proposition "If today is Friday then it is raining"
                
                If p - Today is Friday and q - It is raining
                Then the proposition can be represented as p -> q

                Statement:      p -> q      If today is Friday and it is raining
                Converse:       q -> p      If it is raining then today is Friday
                Inverse:        ~p -> ~q    If it is not Friday then it is not raining
                ContraPositive: ~q -> ~p    If it is not raining then today is not Friday
        
        Equivalece of Propositional Statements:
            When the two propositional statements have the same truth value they are said to be equivalent
            Therefore, 
                p -> q is equivalent to its inverse
                p -> q is equivalent to its contraPositive

        -- Satisfiable: The Statement is said to be satisfiable if there exists atleast one input combination that evaluates to TRUE

        Types of propositional statements based on the truth values:
            -- Tautology: The statement is said to be tautology if for all the input combinations the output is TRUE.
            -- Contradiction: If all the input cmbinations lead to FALSE then it is contradiction
            -- Contingency: If output is a combination of TRUE and FALSE. Neither Tautology nor Contradiction

    Inference Rule:
        -- Considering the premises to be TRUE, our conclusion must be TRUE
