Graph Theory:
    Graph (G): 
        A graph G is a tuple consisting a vertex set V, and and edge set E, 
        and the relation that associates with each edge two vertices called its endpoint.
        Ex: 
            G(V, E);
            V = {1, 2, 3}   Set of all the vertices
            E = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)}    Set of all the edges

        Set E contains ORDERED pairs if the graph is DIRECTED
                        UNORDERED pairs if the graph is UNDIRECTED

    Loop: 
        An edge who endpoints are equal is called a loop

    Multi Edges:
        Edges having the same pair of endpoints are called multi-edges

    Simple Graph:
        A graph having no self-loops and multi-edges is a simple graph

    Representation of Graph:
        1. Adjacency List:
        2. Adjacency Matrix:
            a. For a simple graph the adjacency matric has 0 for all leading diagonal entries
            b. For a undirected graph the adjacency matrix is symmetric
            c. The sum of a nodes row is equal to the out-degrees of that node (Also indegrees if the graph is undirected)
    
    Hand Shaking Lemma:
        In any graph G(V, E), the sum of the degrees of vertices is equal to twice the number of edges
            sum(deg(node) for node in V) == 2*|E|

    Isomorphism:
        An isomorphism from a simple grph G to H is a bijection f: V(H) -> V(H)
        and (u, v) in E(G) iff (u, v) in E(H)
        Basically in isomorphic graphs we can map the vertices such that the edges are exactly equal
    
    #simple graphs that can be formed using 'n' Labelled vertices:
        Consider a complete graph with n vertices
        There are n(n-1)//2 edges in the complete graph
        A simple graph will have edges that are a subset of the edges present in the complete graph
        the total subsets that can be formed are 2**|E(Kn)| where Kn is a complete graph with n vertices
    
    Degree Sequence:
        The arrangement of degrees in non-decreasing or non-increasing order
    
    Given a degree sequence can we have a SIMPLE graph giving that degree sequence:
        The procedure works only for SIMPLE graph
        so the graph has not multiple edges or loops
        Havel Hakimi Procedure:
            From the graph if we remove a node wth degree d then,
            the degree of the remaining 'd' distinct nodes with be decremented
            We will do this iteratively until all the nodes are eliminated 

        Ex:
            1. 6 6 6 6 3 3 2 2
               x 5 5 5 2 2 2 1
               x x 4 4 1 1 1 1
               x x x 3 1 0 0 0
                Not Possible

            2. 7 6 6 4 4 3 2 2
               x 5 5 3 3 2 1 1
               x x 4 2 2 1 0 1
               x x x 1 1 0 0 0
               x x x x 0 0 0 0
                Possible

    Relation between MinDeg and MaxDeg of nodes in graph:
        MinDeg <= 2|E| / |V| <= MaxDeg
                    (AvgDeg)

    SubGraph:
        A subgraph of G is a graph H such that
            V(H) is a subset of V(G) and
            E(H) is a subset of E(G) and 
            the assignment of endpoints for edges in H is same as in G

        Simply said a graph that can be obtained by deleting some vertices or some edges

    Induced Subgraph:
        A subgraph that is obtained by deleting only some vertices
    
    NOTE: Whenever a node is deleted then all its associated edges are also deleted
    
    Path:
        A Path is a simple graph whose vertices can be ordered so that the nodes are adjacent iff they are consecutive in the list
        Basically a path
        A Path with 'n' vertices is denoted as Pn

    Cycle:
        A Cycle is a path with the same start and end
        A cycle has same number of vertices and edges included
    
    Complete Graph:
        A graph G in which each an every edges are present is called a complete Graph thus in complete Graph any two pair of vertices are adjacent
        A graph with 'n' vertices has atmost nC2 = n(n-1)//2 edges
        
        For a complete Graph Kn:
            the degree of each vertex is n-1
            the total number of edges is n(n-1)//2

    Clique:
        A clique is defined as a subgraph of the graph that is also complete
        Every edge forms a clique of size 2 (K2)
    
    Independent Set:
        A set of vertices in a graph that are pairwise non-adjacent
        So basically the set of vertices that are not adjacent to one another

        A complete graph's independent set is a empty set as all pair of vertices are adjacent in a cmplete graph

    Bipartite Graph:
        A graph which can be divided into to independent sets U and V
        such that each edge maps a node from U to a node to V
        Since sets U and V are independent no pair of vertices within each set are non-adjacent

    NOTE: A Graph is bipartite iff it has no odd cycle
            The proof is based on the fact that a bipartite can be colored with two colors.
            If there is an odd cycle then the two adjacent nodes of a node will have different colors and then we cant assign any color to our node

    Complete Bipartite Graph:
        A Bipartite Graph in which
        there is an edge from each u in U to all v in V
        A Bipatite Graph such that |U| = n and |V| = m is denoted as K(n, m)

    Maximum number of edges in bipartite graph with 'n' vertices:
        Halve the vertices into two sets u, v
        the maximum edges is u*v
    
    Regular Graph:
        A Graph G is k-Regular graph if all the vertices has degree 'k'
    
        A complete graph Kn is also n-1 Regular
        A cycle graph is also 2-Regular
        number of edges of a k-Regular graph with n vertices is n*k//2 (using Handshaking Lemma)

    HyperCube or K-dimensional Cube (Qk):
        A simple graph whose vertices are binary strings of length 'k'
        and edges are present between the vertices such that their binary strings differ by one

        A binary string of length 'k' can differ with exatly 'k' other binary strings
        Thus each node has degree exactly 'k'
        This a K-dimensional cube is also a K-Regular Graph

        Since the binary strings are of length 'k' then there 2*k binary strings possible and thus
        there are 2**k vertices in K-dimensional Cube

        The number of edges in K-Dimensional Graph is k*(2**(k-1)) and can be obtained by using HandShaking Lemma

    Distance:
        If a graph has a path from u to v, then 
        the distance from u to v i.e. d(u, v) is the minimum cost path from u to v
        If there is no path from u to v then d(u, v) is INF

    Diameter:
        The Diameter of a graph is defined as the longest path between any two pair of vertices
        diameter(G) = max(d(u, v) for u, v in edges(G)) 
        For graph having disconnected components Diameter = INF
        Also means that
            d(u, v) for any pair u, v in G  <= diameter(G)

    Eccentricity of a vertex:
        Defined as the maximum distance that we would have to travel in the worst case to reach any other vertex
        eccentricity(u) = max(d(u, v) for v in vertices(G))

    Radius of a Graph:
        The minimum of athe eccentricities of all the vertices is the radius of the graph
        radius(G) = min(eccentricity(u) for u vertices(G)) 

    Walk:
        It is a list of v0, e1, v1, e2, v2, ...en, vn
        such v[k-1]--e[k]--v[k]
        An edge or a vertex can be visited multiple times in a walk

    Trail:
        A trail is a walk with no repeated edges

    Eularian Graph:
        A graph is called euleria graph if it has a CLOSED TRAIL that includes
        ALL EDGES
        -- We call a closed trail a CIRCUIT
        -- If every vertex of the G has degree atleast 2 then G contains a cycle
        -- A Graph G is euleria iff it has atmost ne non trivial component and its vertices all have even degrees

    Connected and Disconnected Graph:
        A Graph is connected if for all pairs u, v there is a path from u to v
    
    Components:
        A subgraph of a graph that is a connected graph is called a connected component

        For a connected graph that is only one connected component: the graph itself
        For a disconnected graph there can be multiple connected components

        NOTE:
            -- Adding an edge in the graph can reduce the number of connected components by 0 or 1
            -- Removing an edge in the graph can increase the number of connected components by 0 or 1
            -- A graph having n vertices and k edges has atleast n-k components

    Directed Graph/DiGraph:
        DiGraph G is a tuple consisting of a vertex set V(G) and an edge set E(G)
        such that each edge is an ORDERED pair (u, v) where u is the src/tail and v is the dest/head of that edge
        
        Simple DiGraph:
            A DiGraph is a simple DiGraph if there are 
                1. no multiedges: Multiple edges with the same src and dest
                2. no self loops: Edges with the src == dest
    







Questions:

1. Let G be a undirected complete graph K6.
    If vertices of G are labelled, 
    then the number of distinct cycles of length 4 in G are?
        Cycle of length 4 is as follows
        1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4 -- 1

        So we choose 4 vertices in 6C4 ways
        we set the first vertex as the start and end        in 1 way
        and permute the remaining vertices in the middle    in 3! ways

        But 
        1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4 -- 1
        1 -- 4 -- 3 -- 2 -- 1 are same cycles but counted twice

        So finally 
            (6C4 * 3!) // 2 is the answer

2. Graph G has N vertices and K connected componetnts.
    What is the numunum and maximum number of edges?
        MIN = N-K
        MAX = ((N-K+1)(N-K)) // 2

3. Let G be an arbitrary graph with N nodes and K components
    If a vertex is removed from G, the number of components in the res
    lies between k-1 and n-1 ??

    TRUE: Lies between k-1 and n-1
        Assume all isolated components and we get the answer

4. For a graph G there are 2**n vertices corresponding to a subset of a set of size n
    Two vertices G are adjacent iff the sets intersection has two elements.
    
    The number of vertices having zero degrees: ?
        the null set and all the set that have only one element
        
        So there are (n+1) sets that when intersected with any other set has intersection with elements less than two
        So there are n+1 nodes with degree 0


    The number of connected components: ?
        So the nodes having degree zero are isolated components => n+1
        All the remaining nodes form one component => 1
        Total components ==> n+2
